# SDK for building Rust offchain bots for OpenChat plus some example bots

In the root of the repo there are scripts to deploy the Rust offchain example bots.

- [DiceBot](./scripts/deploy_dice_bot.sh)

```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_dice_bot.sh
```

- [LlamaBot](./scripts/deploy_llama_bot.sh)

```bash
  ./scripts/deploy_llama_bot.sh
```

Note: the DiscordBot cannot be deployed locally because it needs to be reachable by Discord.
