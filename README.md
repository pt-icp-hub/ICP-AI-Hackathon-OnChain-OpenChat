# üì¨ü§ñ OnChain AI with OpenChat

Welcome to the **ICP AI Hackathon - OpenChat Integration Template**! This repository showcases how to build an **AI-powered bot** for [OpenChat](https://oc.app), a decentralized messaging dApp on the Internet Computer. This bot runs as a service that integrates with the OpenChat bot SDK and connects to your local OpenChat instance.

This template is based on the official [open-chat-bots](https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat-bots) repository developed by the OpenChat team.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The OpenChat Bot SDK is currently under active development and subject to frequent changes.  
> To ensure stability during the hackathon, we‚Äôve pinned this template to a specific version to avoid breaking changes.  
> If you'd like to explore the latest updates, features, or contribute directly, please refer to the official [open-chat-bots](https://github.com/open-chat-labs/open-chat-bots) repository.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Fork this repo and open a new codespace (we recommend you to select the 4-core machine).
- After it's creation you can select to open the codespace directly in vs code.
- Everything should be setup correctly for you to run the following commands.

---

### 2. Run OpenChat Locally

Pull and run the OpenChat container:

```bash
docker info  # Check that Docker is running
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -d -p 5001:80 -p 8080:8080 --name open-chat openchatlabs/open-chat:latest@sha256:78bd4571eab0066dbec01dc3a7cab218b76f65061a6b5976c095242f4eac20c6
```

Wait a few minutes for everything to setup correctly. Once it‚Äôs running, access OpenChat UI via:

```
http://localhost:5001
```

---

### 3. Start dfx & Deploy the Bot

```bash
cd open-chat-bots/rs && dfx start --clean --background
./../scripts/deploy_echo_bot.sh
```

Once the bot is deployed, its description will be available at:

```bash
http://<YOU_CANISTER_ID>.raw.localhost:4943
```

     ```
     /register_bot
     ```
   - This will prompt you to enter bot information.  
     ![Step 3: Use /register_bot](./screenshots/image3.png)

4. **Fill Out Bot Info**

   - Use the information provided by the deployment script (`deploy_echo_bot.sh`) to fill out the form.  
     ![Step 4: Fill Bot Info](./screenshots/image4.png)

5. **Add the Bot to Your Group**

   - Click the **group members** icon at the top right of the chat.
